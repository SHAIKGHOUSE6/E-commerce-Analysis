## Objective
Analyze e-commerce sales data to evaluate pricing patterns, revenue trends, and product performance.

## Dataset
- 2,000 transaction records
- Sales, pricing, and category attributes

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- KPI computation (Revenue, AOV, category sales)
- Random Forest Regression modeling (80–20 split)

## Results
- R² Score: 0.99
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.30
- Computed total revenue and average order value (AOV)
- Analyzed price-band contribution percentages

## Key Insights
- Mid-priced products contribute the highest share of revenue
- Certain categories dominate overall sales volume
- Pricing bands reveal clear revenue concentration patterns

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, SQL, Scikit-Learn, Power BI

## How to Run
1. Open `Ecommerce (1).ipynb`
2. Execute cells in order to reproduce analysis
