# E-commerce-Analysis
🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior, product performance, pricing patterns, and sales trends. The goal is to extract actionable business insights using SQL and Python, similar to what a data analyst does in a real e-commerce company.

Analyze sales and revenue trends.
Identify top-performing products and categories.
Understand customer purchasing behavior.
Evaluate price bands and their impact on revenue.
Detect seasonality and demand patterns.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL (PostgreSQL) – data extraction & aggregation
Python – data cleaning, analysis, visualization
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
